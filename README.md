# about Pentomino - Wikipedia
A pentomino (or 5-omino) is a polyomino of order 5; that is, a polygon in the plane made 
of 5 equal-sized squares connected edge to edge. The term is derived from the Greek word 
for '5' and "domino". When rotations and reflections are not considered to be distinct shapes,
there are 12 different free pentominoes. When reflections are considered distinct, there are
18 one-sided pentominoes. When rotations are also considered distinct, there are 63 fixed pentominoes.
